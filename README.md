# HACKWEIRED-24-HOURS-IOT-HACKATHON-
During the 24-hour Hardwired Hackathon, we built a smart system that detected potholes and recorded their GPS locations. 📍 Data was wirelessly sent to a website we developed from scratch, allowing real-time updates and post-repair status tracking. It was an intense, rewarding experience that boosted our learning and teamwork. 🚀
